1) What is Version Control System 

Version Control sysstem is a systsem that records changes to a file or set of files

There are various version control systems are there as

	-> Local Version Control Systems

	-> Centralized Version Control Systems

	-> Distributed Version Control Systems (GIT)


2) Why Vesion Control System : 

	Version Control system provides idea of coding implemented in earlier versions

	Gives you great support for different version of same project 

	Providing concurrent work and implements merge changes 


Git : 

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to large projects with speed and efficiency. 

Every git working directory contains a full flexged repository with complete history of tracking capabilities.

It is not dependent on neetwork acccess or a central server. 

Goals : 

   Speed

   Support for development

   Fully Distributed

   Able to handle large projects efficiently


In Git we have main states or areas known as

   -> Working Directory 

	This is the git repository diretory, where we can store all the information. 

   -> Staging Area : It is a simple file, generally presnent in your git diretory, that stores information 
		about all the commits. {whatever code you want to push, first to be commited into staging area}

   -> Git Local Directory : This is the local git repository, where the changes get finalized before going to 				git remote. 

   -> Git Remote Directory : This is the directory, where we can get all updated commited code, and all changes 				will be reflected here.

After creating repository, open git bash and in that run the below commands

git config --global user.name "prasannakasyap"

git config --global user.email "puiangtraining@gmail.com"


First step you need to do is 

Once any client gives git repo, first you need to clone that. 

for that you please run the command as

git clone gitUrl
